\ Jan Langevad  posted in our Forth2020 group, this modification to run diff. tasks inside a COLON def.
\ "Here a TIP regarding starting a TASK from a colon definition/a word (ESP32Forth).
\ You need this "EVALUATE trick" if you will have an "embedded system", that includes one or more TASKs, 
\ you will have started  without operator intervention.
\ For demo, I have modified the simple TASK example from our online ESP32Forth Glossary.
\ : hi begin ." Time is: " ms-ticks . cr 10000 ms PAUSE 
\      again ; \ Print the tick every 10sec.
\ The words to make and start this as a task,  can apparently not be used directly inside a word.
\ Therefore the task words are put in a  string, and executed by EVALUATE.
\ This trick is NOT invented by me, but I got it from Peter Forth yesterday " 


: hi    begin .
               " Time is: " ms-ticks . cr 
                10000 ms PAUSE 
        again  \ Print the tick every 10sec.
;
: PREP-HI 
          S" ' hi 100 100 task my-counter" 
                EVALUATE  \ define my-counter task
          S"  my-counter start-task" 
                EVALUATE  \ start the my-counter task
;
